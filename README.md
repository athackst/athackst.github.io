# My personal website

This website is built atop [the `github/personal-website` repository](https://github.com/github/personal-website) and [my vscode_website_workspace](https://github.com/athackst/vscode_website_workspace).

## Customization

All content is set through `_config.yml`.  The rest of the template covers formatting and layout.  While the template supports posts and pages, I don't intend on using them in this site.  Instead, I will rely on weekly deploys to keep the repositories updated.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
