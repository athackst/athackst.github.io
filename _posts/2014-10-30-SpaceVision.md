I was an invited speaker at the SpaceVision annual national conference of Students for the Exploration and Development of Space.  

**Panel: Relying on Robots: The Smart Choice for Dirty Jobs?**  

_From the beginning of humanity's exploration of space, unmanned systems have played a crucial role. Robotics enables the extension of the reach of the human imagination, and robots will continue as our early ambassadors in space. From rovers on Mars to the robotics arms on ISS, engineers have been able to do amazing things to further our extraterrestrial influence and understanding. With the onset of the private space industry, human ingenuity is being taken to another level to develop other groundbreaking technologies. How will we use AI techniques to interpret the vast amounts of information these systems send back to Earth? What form will these technologies take, and how will this be influenced by the destinations to which they journey? How will humans and robots cooperate to best achieve the aspirations of humanity?_
