        INNOVATE TO CREATE.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Improving
        and bridging disparate technologies can lead to unprecedented results. &nbsp;I specialize in sensor fusion, visual servoing, and path planning. &nbsp;I create solutions that use multiple forms of feedback to increase reliability and adaptation. &nbsp;I like to fail smart and I program my robots to do the same.

        Dream BIG.

      <p>
        I am a firm believer that anything is possible. &nbsp;It is the times when you stretch the hardware and software to its limits that the most creative solutions are discovered. &nbsp;My driving passion is to create robots that will change the world.
