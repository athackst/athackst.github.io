  <p>Allison is currently solving some of the toughest problems in robotics at Nuro where she aims to accelerate the benefits
    of robotics for everyday life.</p>
  <p>Allison previously held the position of Engineering Lead and Manager of the Shared Autonomy Robotics team at Toyota
    Research Institute. Her team focused on developing advanced robotic teleoperation technologies that enable robots
    and people to seamlessly and safely work together. She also worked as the Lead Manipulation Researcher/Project
    Manager at Toyota Partner Robotic Group where she investigated robust task and motion planning manipulation
    strategies in unstructured environments.</p>
  <p>Before joining Toyota, she was the Lead Engineer for Robotic Perception on Robonaut 2, the first humanoid robot on
    the International Space Station. There, she was responsible for software development and applied vision research to
    facilitate the cooperation between robots and people. </p>
