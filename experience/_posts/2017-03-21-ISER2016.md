Conference Paper, 2016 International Symposium on Experimental Robotics  

**[A System for Multi-step Mobile Manipulation: Architecture, Algorithms, and Experiments](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/amj1/papers/ISER2016.pdf)**  

**Abstract**
Household manipulation presents a challenge to robots because it requires perceiving a variety of objects, planning multi-step motions, and recovering from failure. This paper presents practical techniques that improve performance in these areas by considering the complete system in the context of this specific domain. We validate these techniques on a table-clearing task that involves loading objects into a tray and transporting it. The results show that these techniques improve success rate and task completion time by incorporating expected real-world performance into the system design.
